# Experimental/Unused Code

This directory contains experimental or unused code that has been moved out of the main codebase for portfolio presentation.

## Files

- **driver_standings.py**: An alternative implementation of driver standings display (unused - replaced by `list_builder.py`)
- **test_api.py**: API testing script (used during development)
- **turtle_sim.py**: Early experimental code for race simulation visualization

These files are kept for reference but are not part of the main application.
